<!-- Unit 5 Assignment

  Requirements:
• Start by changing the orientation of the cards so that they are structured into a conventional two by two grid layout.
• Next, create a navbar for the game with links to the Instructions and Game sections as if they were on two separate pages.
• Style the navbar in a way that lets users know when they are hovering over a clickable item.
• Finally, be sure to add some color to your footer. It's always great to keep the User Experience (UX) in mind!
